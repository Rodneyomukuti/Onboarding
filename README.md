# Welcome!!! Karibu!!

This repository contains the onboarding resources and readings that are recommended for when you join the Bioinformatics Group at the Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics Unit, *icipe*.

In this repository, you will find our code of conduct, and the first steps you'll take as you join our group. 

## Bioinformatics Gropo Vision
**Mission (purpose):** To lead and support cutting-edge bioinformatics research and data management at *icipe*.

**Vision (Picture):** To become a vibrant, productive, innovative, and flexible bioinformatics training, research and data management hub.

**Values:**
- Integrity
- Excellence
- Collaboration


## First steps
1. Read and familiarise yourself with the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This is an essential document in the Unit.
2. Create your project GitHub repo. Your repo should outline your vision and provide a Roadmap or your research. See the following resources on how to draft a detailed [README](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) and create a [Roadmap](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/start-your-project-roadmap/).  Although these resources are for open projects, they are useful when working with your collaborators (You supervisors, and your future self) during your project.
3. Farmiliarise yourslf with the research being undertaken within the Center and the unit. You can do this through planned lab visits, and by chatting with the students and researchers within the Unit.
